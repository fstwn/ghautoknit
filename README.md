# GHAutoknit - Bridging Grasshopper and Autoknit

A prototypical bridge between Rhino / Grasshopper and [Autoknit](https://github.com/textiles-lab/autoknit).

**WARNING: This code is unfinished. I never completed it because I moved on to another approach!**

However, it is actually possible to use this.
- You need a compiled version of Autoknit.
- You need to set the ``_AK_RAW_PATH_`` variable in ``ghautoknit/Environment.py`` to the folder where your ``interface.exe`` is located.
- With everything set up, it should be possible to run ``Examples/GHAutoknit.gh``.
